/**
 * Centralized query key factories — avoids stringly-typed duplication
 * across hooks. Every leaf is a function (even parameterless ones), so
 * call sites are always `queryKeys.x.y()` — a single consistent syntax
 * with no special-cased plain-array exceptions to remember.
 *
 * Naming: `detail(id)` returns the raw domain entity (Idea/Project);
 * `detailView(id)` returns the aggregated, page-ready ViewModel produced
 * by the corresponding *DetailsService. The two are deliberately named
 * differently since they cache different shapes for different callers.
